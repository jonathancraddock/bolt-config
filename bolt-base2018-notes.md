## Some notes on Bolt Base-2018 them

The Base-2018 theme is a nice looking default template. The following are some notes for future reference.

### Wireframes

There's a set of wireframes available under: File Management... View Edit Templates.

### About Us

The "Aside" on the homepage features an "about" block. The title can be anything, but ensure the unique alias is set to "about-us".

### Hero

Opening the homepage you're greeted with "A Sample Site, The amazing payoff goes here". This legend comes from: Configuration... Main configuration. The "sitename" value will also be added to the left-side of the Navbar.
